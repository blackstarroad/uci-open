							<p>Founded in 1965, The University of California, Irvine combines the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location. Over four remarkable decades, UCI has become internationally recognized for efforts that are improving lives through research and discovery, fostering excellence in scholarship and teaching, and engaging and enriching the community.</p>

							<p>UCI is among the fastest-growing campuses in the UC system. Increasingly a first-choice campus for students, UCI attracts record numbers of undergraduate applications each year and admits freshmen with highly competitive academic profiles. UCI is a center for quality education and is consistently ranked among the nation’s best universities. Achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, medicine, and management have garnered top 50 national rankings for more than 40 academic programs. Three UCI researchers have won Nobel Prizes—two in chemistry and one in physics.</p>
				
							<p>The University launched its OpenCourseWare initiative in November 2006. As the first West Coast university and UC campus to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium (OCWC), our OCW project is growing rapidly with the addition of nearly10 new courses every month. Many of our OCW offerings are directed at working adults seeking continuing education, with the option to enroll in instructor-led, for-credit courses, related to the OCW content. Our OCW initiative is supported partly by funding from extra-mural sponsors like the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation—funding that has allowed for the development of OCW created specifically or targeted audiences such as California public school teachers seeking help in passing state examinations for single-subject science and mathematics credentials. In addition, our OCW Web site also provides students and self learners around the globe with access to UCI-faculty created undergraduate and graduate courses that are currently being taught to matriculated UCI students.</p>

										<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
										</a>
									</div>
									
									<div id="faq" class="accordion-body collapse">
										<div class="accordion-inner">
											<h4>What is OCW?</h4>
											<a name="FAQ"></a>
											<p>An OpenCourseWare (OCW) is a free and open digital publication of high quality university-level educational materials, organized as courses and often including syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and assessments. While OCW initiatives typically do not provide a degree, credit, certification, or access to instructors, the materials are made available, for free, under open licenses for use and adaption by educators and learners around the world.</p>

											<h4>What is UC Irvine's OCW?</h4>
											<p>The University of California, Irvine’s OCW is a web-based repository of various UC Irvine courses and video lectures from UC Irvine faculty, seminar participants, and instructional staff. While the great majority of courses are drawn from graduate, undergraduate, and continuing education programs, some were originally produced under grant funding to serve specific needs in California and elsewhere. UC Irvine’s OCW is open and available to the world for free.</p>
									
											<h4>What is UC Irvine's Contribution to the OCW Movement?</h4>
											<p>The University of California, Irvine has a long history of social engagement. As a leading public research University, an important part of its mission is to showcase and disseminate the research and scholarship of the University to the public. Open educational content is a concept that will advance human knowledge, creativity, lifelong learning, and the social welfare of educators, students, and self-learners across the globe. As a proud member of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, UC Irvine strives to meet the following goals:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>To meet the University of California’s desire to play a significant role in the contribution to the social welfare of the state, the nation and the world</li>
												<li>To showcase the University’s top instructional efforts and make those courses and course materials free on a global scale to educators, students, and self-learners</li>
												<li>To create educational assets that are discoverable, searchable, and modifiable under Creative Commons licenses</li>
											</ul>
											
											<h4>How do I register to use UC Irvine's OCW?</h4>
											<p>There is no registration or enrollment process because UC Irvine’s OCW is not a credit-bearing or degree-granting initiative. In addition, UC Irvine’s OCW courses do not feature an instructor and we do not provide access to faculty members for instruction. There also are no prerequisites for users who want to use UC Irvine’s OCW course materials in their own learning.</p>
											
											<h4>Can I enroll in for-credit online courses?</h4>
											<p>In some cases, yes. Credit can be gained through one of several mechanisms: taking for-credit coursework (fees apply) offered at the University's continuing education unit, <a href="http://unex.uci.edu">UC Irvine Extension</a>, through <a href="http://unex.uci.edu/courses/access_uci/">Access UCI</a>, <a href="http://summer.uci.edu">Summer Session</a>, or through the normal admissions process, such as the online <a href="http://clsmas.soceco.uci.edu/" >Master of Advanced Studies in Criminology</a>, Law and Society degree program. For more information, please contact Kathy Tam at <a href="mailto:kstam@uci.edu">kstam@uci.edu</a> or visit <a href="http://unex.uci.edu/">UC Irvine Extension's Web site</a>.
											
											<h4>Can I get a certificate of completion fron UC Irvine's OpenCourseWare?</h4>
											<p>No. UC Irvine’s OCW does not offer certificates of completion at this time. You should work through the courses at your own pace, and in whatever manner you desire.</p>
											
											<h4>How can I use UC Irvine’s OCW course materials?</h4>
											<p>UC Irvine’s OCW is a Web-based publication of the courses and course materials that support an education at the University. Educators are encouraged to use the materials for curriculum development, while students can augment their current learning by making use of the materials offered, and self-learners are encouraged to draw upon the material for self-study or supplementary use. Course materials offered on the UC Irvine Web site typically may be used, copied, distributed, translated and modified, but only for non-commercial educational purposes that are made freely available to other users. Each course shows its own license provisions, so please check carefully. All licenses permit reuse, but the following restrictions may apply:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Non-commercial:</b> Use of UC Irvine OCW materials is open to all, except for profit-making entities who charge a fee for access to educational materials.</li>
												<li><b>Attribution:</b> Any and all use or reuse of the material, including use of derivative works (new materials that incorporate or draw on the original materials), must be attributed to the University of California, Irvine and, if a member of the faculty or instructional staff is associated with the material, to that person’s name and title as well.</li>
												<li><b>Share alike (aka "copyleft"):</b> Any publication or distribution of original or derivative works, including production of electronic or printed Web site materials or placement of materials on a website, must offer the works freely and openly to others under the same terms that UC Irvine OCW first made the works available to the user.</li>
												<li><b>No derivatives:</b> No modifications can be made to the materials themselves. If you would like to use UC Irvine OCW course materials, but are unsure whether your intended use qualifies as non-commercial use, please contact Kathy Tam at <a href="mailto:kstam@uci.edu">kstam@uci.edu</a> for clarification.</b></li>
											</ul>
											
											<h4>How do I contribute my course materials?</h4>
											<p>If you are a member of either the UC Irvine faculty or instructional staff, the UC Irvine OCW staff provides licenses and a publication release form. Please contact us at 824-6260 or email <a href="mailto:ocw@uci.edu">ocw@uci.edu</a>.</p>
