										<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
										</a>
									</div>
									
									<div id="faq" class="accordion-body collapse">
										<div class="accordion-inner">
											<h4>What is OCW?</h4>
											<a name="FAQ"></a>
											<p>An OpenCourseWare (OCW) is an open educational resource organized as typical components of course materials, often including syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and assessments. While OCW initiatives typically do not provide a degree, credit, certification, or access to instructors, the materials are made available, for free, under open licenses for use and adaption by educators and learners around the world.</p>

											<h4>What is UC Irvine's Open Education project?</h4>
											<p>The University of California, Irvine’s OCW is a web-based repository of various UC Irvine courses and video lectures from UC Irvine faculty, seminar participants, and instructional staff. While the great majority of courses are drawn from graduate, undergraduate, and continuing education programs, some were originally produced under grant funding to serve specific needs in California and elsewhere. UC Irvine’s OCW is open and available to the world for free.</p>
									
											<h4>What is UC Irvine's Contribution to the OCW Movement?</h4>
											<p>The University of California, Irvine has a long history of social engagement. As a leading public research University, an important part of its mission is to showcase and disseminate the research and scholarship of the University to the public. Open educational content is a concept that will advance human knowledge, creativity, lifelong learning, and the social welfare of educators, students, and self-learners across the globe. As a proud member of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, UC Irvine strives to meet the following goals:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>To meet the University of California’s desire to play a significant role in the contribution to the social welfare of the state, the nation and the world</li>
												<li>To showcase the University’s top instructional efforts and make those courses and course materials free on a global scale to educators, students, and self-learners</li>
												<li>To create educational assets that are discoverable, searchable, and modifiable under Creative Commons licenses</li>
											</ul>
											
											<h4>How do I register to use UC Irvine's OCW?</h4>
											<p>There is no registration or enrollment process because UC Irvine’s OCW is not a credit-bearing or degree-granting initiative. In addition, UC Irvine’s OCW courses do not feature an instructor and we do not provide access to faculty members for instruction. There also are no prerequisites for users who want to use UC Irvine’s OCW course materials in their own learning.</p>
											
											<h4>Can I enroll in for-credit online courses?</h4>
											<p>In some cases, yes. Credit can be gained through one of several mechanisms: taking for-credit coursework (fees apply) offered at the University's continuing education unit, <a href="http://unex.uci.edu">UC Irvine Extension</a>, through <a href="http://unex.uci.edu/courses/access_uci/">Access UCI</a>, <a href="http://summer.uci.edu">Summer Session</a>, or through the normal admissions process, such as the online <a href="http://clsmas.soceco.uci.edu/" >Master of Advanced Studies in Criminology</a>, Law and Society degree program. For more information, please contact Kathy Tam at <a href="mailto:kstam@uci.edu">kstam@uci.edu</a> or visit <a href="http://unex.uci.edu/">UC Irvine Extension's Web site</a>.
											
											<h4>Can I get a certificate of completion fron UC Irvine's OpenCourseWare?</h4>
											<p>No. UC Irvine’s OCW does not offer certificates of completion at this time. You should work through the courses at your own pace, and in whatever manner you desire.</p>
											
						 <h4>How do I contribute my course materials?</h4>
											<p>If you are a member of either the UC Irvine faculty or instructional staff, the UC Irvine OCW staff provides licenses and a publication release form. Please contact us at 824-6260 or email <a href="mailto:ocw@uci.edu">ocw@uci.edu</a>.</p>

												<h3>Director, UCI OpenCourseWare</h3>
												<p>Larry Cooperman is a respected international consultant on open education. He serves as president of the Open Education Consortium (OEC), a global organization of 300 universities, colleges and educational organizations. The OEC is the newly renamed organization founded by MIT in 2006 as the OpenCourseWare Consortium. He has been an invited speaker at a UNESCO/MofE conference in Brazil, at TEDx in Medellin, Colombia, at the Korea OCW Consortium conference, at the plenary debate on OER at eLearning Africa, and others. He is a member of the boards of directors of the OpenCourseWare Consortium and the African Virtual University and leads the UC-Haiti Initiative's distance learning activities. Many organizations intend to adopt open education as a guiding principle, but face a series of obstacles. Cooperman's activity, principally in Africa and Latin America, has served to assist organizations and governments to take advantage of open education repositories, projects, and websites.</p>
												<p style="text-align:center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1uWHMdMC8HQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></p>
												<p>Examples: </p>
												<ol>
													<li><strong>African Virtual University</strong>. Larry has submitted a draft policy for the functioning of its open education repository OER@AVU. The issue of the repository is an important one. It has to balance the AVU's capacity-building emphasis, e.g. reliance on the work of African academics, with a need to expand it from its origins as the repository of resources created solely by the AVU. Cooperman has proposed a series of board policies calling for a curated approach to repository building, combined with opening the repository to African academics both in sub-Saharan Africa as well as the entire African academic diaspora.</li> 
													<li><strong>SENA, Colombia</strong>. Larry met with the Vice-Minister of Education, and the senior advisor to President Santos on social prosperity, and with one of four national directors of SENA (National Learning Service) to attempt to define an open education project around Food Security. Some 35 universities attended a breakfast talk by Cooperman and Carolina Botero at the height of this activity.</li> 
													<li><strong>UNILAB, Brazil</strong>. UNILAB is a project launched by former Cooperman Lula to develop an Afro-Brazilian/African multinational university. Larry was invited by Rector Paolo Speller to help define what "openness" would mean for its faculty. UNILAB subsequently became a formal partner of the African Virtual University through an agreement authored by Cooperman.</li>
													<li><strong>Universite de l'Etat d'Haiti</strong>. Cooperman wrote a report on distance learning readiness following a weeklong assessment trip for the UC-Haiti Initiative in September. While the trip intended to primarily address distance learning, Cooperman met with the Chancellor and others to urge the adoption of open education as a modality by which UEH could better serve all of Haiti and not just its matriculated students. His report has been translated to French and distributed in Haiti to key personnel.</li>
													<li><strong>Open Education Week</strong>. Cooperman developed a scheduled webcast capability in which 144 hours of continuous programming was shown throughout the week, with locale-adapted time schedules.</li>

													<h3>UI/UX Designer</h3>
													<p>Joined in 2012, Joseph &ndash; in a few short months &ndash; stepped up beyond the call of duty of filing papers and led a new web design for the Open Courseware website. He is a lover of all things ridiculous, satirical, and &ndash; bordering insanity &ndash; fuzzy (read: cats of the funny variety). Allegedly living in Irvine, CA, Joseph is a fierce reader of all things web-y and tech-related and occasionally produces relevant podcasts for internet publication. Other side projects include music composition of the Rock variety, designing logos, and not taking biographies seriously.

<br>Joseph is currently a student at UC Irvine for a B.S. in Informatics, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction.
