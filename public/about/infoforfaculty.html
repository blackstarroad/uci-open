                    If you are interested in having your class filmed for inclusion on the UCI OCW website, please contact us in advance of the start of the quarter. Unless your course has a sponsor, we cannot necessarily guarantee we will be able to film your course, but interested faculty are always encouraged to contact us!

                    We utilize a two camera set-up to capture the professor and the slides or blackboard from the back of the classroom. Instructors are asked to wear a microphone. Most instructors have found that the video taping is not disruptive to the class and the students in your class benefit from reviewing the lectures.
