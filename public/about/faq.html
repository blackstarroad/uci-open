                    <h4>What is OCW?</h4>
                </div>

                <p>An OpenCourseWare (OCW) is an open educational resource organized as typical components of course materials, often including syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and assessments. While OCW initiatives typically do not provide a degree, credit, certification, or access to instructors, the materials are made available, for free, under open licenses for use and adaption by educators and learners around the world.</p>

                    <h4>What is UC Irvine's Open Education project?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>The University of California, Irvine’s OCW is a web-based repository of various UC Irvine courses and video lectures from UC Irvine faculty, seminar participants, and instructional staff. While the great majority of courses are drawn from graduate, undergraduate, and continuing education programs, some were originally produced under grant funding to serve specific needs in California and elsewhere. UC Irvine’s OCW is open and available to the world for free.</p>

                        <h4>What is UC Irvine's Contribution to the OCW Movement?</h4>
                </div>

                <p>The University of California, Irvine has a long history of social engagement. As a leading public research University, an important part of its mission is to showcase and disseminate the research and scholarship of the University to the public. Open educational content is a concept that will advance human knowledge, creativity, lifelong learning, and the social welfare of educators, students, and self-learners across the globe. As a proud member of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, UC Irvine strives to meet the following goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To meet the University of California’s desire to play a significant role in the contribution to the social welfare of the state, the nation and the world</li>
                    <li>To showcase the University’s top instructional efforts and make those courses and course materials free on a global scale to educators, students, and self-learners</li>
                    <li>To create educational assets that are discoverable, searchable, and modifiable under Creative Commons licenses</li>
                </ul>

                	<h4>How do I register to use UC Irvine's OCW?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>There is no registration or enrollment process because UC Irvine’s OCW is not a credit-bearing or degree-granting initiative. In addition, UC Irvine’s OCW courses do not feature an instructor and we do not provide access to faculty members for instruction. There also are no prerequisites for users who want to use UC Irvine’s OCW course materials in their own learning.</p>
                <div class="accordion-heading">
                    <h4>Can I enroll in for-credit online courses?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>In some cases, yes.

            		<h4>Where can I find information about Admissions?</h4>
            	</div>
            	<p>All information about admissions to graduate and undergraduate programs can be accessed here: <a href="http://uci.edu/admissions/index.php">http://uci.edu/admissions/index.php</a>.

            		<h4>How can I contact a professor?</h4>
            	</div>
            	<p>On most course and lecture pages, the author’s name is typically linked to their UCI faculty page. On this page, you may find a listed email. Please contact them for appropriate professional questions. They cannot provide support for our freely provided resources.

            		<h4>How do I access the files I downloaded from a course page?</h4>
            	</div>
            	<p>The download on course pages provides the opportunity to download the associated files and pages of a course with one big exception: videos are referenced only by URL. The download file has a .imscc suffix, which stands for IMS Common Cartridge format. However, it can be opened with any .zip program, such as 7-Zip or the Windows File Manager. We are still testing it for export/import capability with LMS systems, including Moodle and Canvas. For now, you can treat it like a zipped archive and get at the resources. Remember that the Creative Commons licenses apply to appropriate use – and enjoy!</p>
