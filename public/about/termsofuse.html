            <h4>How can I use UC Irvine’s OCW course materials?</h4>
            <p>UC Irvine’s OCW is a Web-based publication of the courses and course materials that support higher education. Educators are encouraged to use the materials for curriculum development, while students can augment their current learning by making use of the materials offered, and self-learners are encouraged to draw upon the material for self-study or supplementary use. Course materials offered on the UC Irvine Web site typically may be used, copied, distributed, translated and modified, but only for non-commercial educational purposes that are made freely available to other users. Each course shows its own license provisions, so please check carefully. All licenses permit reuse, but the following restrictions may apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Non-commercial:</b> Use of UC Irvine OCW materials is open to all, except for profit-making entities who charge a fee for access to educational materials. If you would like to use UC Irvine OCW course materials, but are unsure whether your intended use qualifies as non-commercial use, please contact Kathy Tam at <a href="mailto:kstam@uci.edu">kstam@uci.edu</a> for clarification.</li>
                <li><b>Attribution </b>(always required)<b>:</b> Any and all use or reuse of the material, including use of derivative works (new materials that incorporate or draw on the original materials), must be attributed to the University of California, Irvine and, if a member of the faculty or instructional staff is associated with the material, to that person’s name and title as well. </li>
                <li><b>Sharealike:</b> Any publication or distribution of original or derivative works, including production of electronic or printed Web site materials or placement of materials on a website, must offer the works freely and openly to others under the same terms that UC Irvine OCW first made the works available to the user.</li>
                <li><b>No derivatives:</b> No modifications can be made to the materials themselves. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4><a name="requiredattribution">How do I properly attribute or cite a work found on the UCI OCW website?</a></h4>
            <p>The core attribution must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Author. This is typically the professor or lecturer of a course. However, it may include multiple people, as in the case of panelists or team-taught courses.</li>
                <li>Title of course or lecture.</li>
                <li>Link to source URL on OCW website.</li>
