SYNOPSIS

This software package may be used to create an open education publishing site, permitting the maintenance of OERs, including forms that provide information on authors, universities, schools, departments, licenses (All CC variants, including versions 3.0 and 4.0). It also provides both hierarchical and category search as well as exports via IMS Common Cartridge. The backend contains a drag-and-drop capability to organize OERs into video lectures with associated files, courses, or collections of any kinds. The header and footer is configurable and pages have associated templates from which to choose.

MOTIVATION

The University of California, Irvine OPEN project has been creating requirements and specifications for this software for the past several years in collaboration with Aconcagua Software Factory and WebBrokers, Inc. Our goal is to support the open education movement through providing easy to use software.
